<p>Welcome and thank you for taking time to visit my website. 
As one of your elected representatives I want to make sure that you get chance to see 
what I doing and for you to get to raise issues with me.
 My intention always is to be as open as possible share whatever information that I have as widely as possible. 
I do however understand how important it is for people to know that they can come to me in confidence 
so the website will not contain any personal issues unless it has the constant for the individual.</p>
